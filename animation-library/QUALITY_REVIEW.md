# Animation quality review

All 27 clips received a playback-stability pass. Technical checks passed for all 603 final cells. This report separates those checks from subjective motion quality.

Validation: `node tests/library-quality.cjs`, `node tests/library-scale.cjs`, `node tests/sprite-player.mjs`, action regression tests, and `python3 tools/validate-animation-library.py`.

Contact sheets and measurements: `../output/library-motion-review/`. No automatic measurement certifies premium animation or supplies missing inbetween drawings.


Blowing_Whistle was added after the original quality pass. Its fixed grip/body/feet, joined prop, clipping, extension and loop seam are checked by `node tests/whistle.cjs`. Original generated art and exact prompt are in `animation/sparky/improved/28-blowing-whistle/whistle-v1/`. Artistic review remains separate from those checks.


Cute_Bounce_Dance replaces the hip-sway variant. Source: `cute-bounce-v1/`; tests check rigid head size, fixed shoe pixels, two matching bounce beats and the loop seam.
